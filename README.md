**[dennybritz's original code](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf) supports python 3,but not support Chinese
**[indiejoseph's original code](https://github.com/indiejoseph/cnn-text-classification-tf-chinese) supports Chinese,but it does not support python3 and tensorflow 1.1
I mixed them up.It works.

The highway has been removed because i dont know how to make it work on tf 1.1 
The following are their original README:

## CNN for Chinese Text Classification in Tensorflow
Sentiment classification forked from [dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf), make the data helper supports Chinese language and modified the embedding from word-level to character-level, though that increased vocabulary size, and also i've implemented the [Character-Aware Neural Language Models](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06615v4.pdf) network structure which CNN + Highway network to improve the performance, this version can achieve an accuracy of 98% with the Chinese corpus




**[This code belongs to the "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post.](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)**

It is slightly simplified implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tensorflow > 0.12
- Numpy

## Training

Print parameters:

```bash
./train.py --help
```

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --embedding_dim EMBEDDING_DIM
                        Dimensionality of character embedding (default: 128)
  --filter_sizes FILTER_SIZES
                        Comma-separated filter sizes (default: '3,4,5')
  --num_filters NUM_FILTERS
                        Number of filters per filter size (default: 128)
  --l2_reg_lambda L2_REG_LAMBDA
                        L2 regularizaion lambda (default: 0.0)
  --dropout_keep_prob DROPOUT_KEEP_PROB
                        Dropout keep probability (default: 0.5)
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch Size (default: 64)
  --num_epochs NUM_EPOCHS
                        Number of training epochs (default: 100)
  --evaluate_every EVALUATE_EVERY
                        Evaluate model on dev set after this many steps
                        (default: 100)
  --checkpoint_every CHECKPOINT_EVERY
                        Save model after this many steps (default: 100)
  --allow_soft_placement ALLOW_SOFT_PLACEMENT
                        Allow device soft device placement
  --noallow_soft_placement
  --log_device_placement LOG_DEVICE_PLACEMENT
                        Log placement of ops on devices
  --nolog_device_placement

```

Train:

```bash
./train.py
```

## Evaluating

```bash
./eval.py --eval_train --checkpoint_dir="./runs/1459637919/checkpoints/"
```

Replace the checkpoint dir with the output from the training. To use your own data, change the `eval.py` script to load your data.
